1. Download all ZIP files of this folder
2. Unpack it to a folder of the computer
3. Make the needed changes with a temporary instance, or to the Prism Launcher
   (don't leave any instances created. This content is the base content that will be downloaded to the players, and therefore can only contain the
   Prism Launcher empty.)
4. After all changes done, using 7-Zip, compact all the content that you have unpacked before, but splitting into pieces of 15MB
   The name of the parts must be like "current-game-data.zip.XXX"
5. Copy all parts to the folder "Repository-Pages/game-data"
6. Update the file "current-game-data-info.json" to have the current version of game data available for download in this repository and the links for
   each part of the game data ZIP file.
7. The Launcher will download these data and apply on to the players that don't have the game data downloaded.
